Icon explorer for Material-UI React library
### [Live Demo](http://golle404.github.io/mui-icon-explorer/)
[Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) is a set of [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) components that implement [Google's Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) specification.

It comes with bunch of SVG icons already bundled as React components, so many that it could be bit difficult to find right one.

So, I made this little app to help with it :-) Icons are grouped by categories, and clicking on one will copy it's import statement to clipboard.
For example :   
```javascript
import CommunicationBusiness from 'material-ui/lib/svg-icons/communication/business'
```
